# todos

Simple Todos app built with flutter.
This app uses `provider` for state management.

This is the final app from the tutorial I wrote about how to create a Todos app with Flutter and Provider. You can read it [here](https://dev.to/shakib609/create-a-todos-app-with-flutter-and-provider-jdh) and follow along from there, or just take a look at the code yourself.

## Setup

```
$ git clone https://github.com/shakib609/todos-flutter.git
$ cd todos-flutter
$ flutter packages get
$ flutter run
```
